## Design Direction

The design should evoke feelings of **organization, professionalism, and teamwork**. The hub interface should feel like a well-designed workspace portal - modern and inviting, with clear visual hierarchy that makes navigation intuitive. Individual modules like the Guide Library should maintain consistent design language while having their own focused personality. The overall experience should reduce cognitive load through clear information architecture and familiar interaction patterns.
